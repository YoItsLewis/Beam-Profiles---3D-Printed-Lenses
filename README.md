# Beam-Profiles---3D-Printed-Lenses
## Data visualisation code for in house 3D printed lenses for analysis and comparison to industrial grade manufactured glass lenses

Beam profiles were reconstructed using two scripts (https://github.com/YoItsLewis/Beam-Profiles-3D-Printed-Lenses) based on the NumPy, os, matplotlib.pyplot and mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 functions in Python 3.9.7 (32-bit) in a Spyder IDE 5.4.3 environment on a Microsoft Windows 10 Pro running a 64-bit Windows 10 operating system with an Intel® Core™ i7-7660U 2.50GHz dual-core processor with 8 GB of 1867 MT/s DDR3 RAM. This code was then compiled and commented in a JupyterLab IDE 3.5.3 environment using the same model of laptop.
